doot
==

An bash program to wrap graphviz' dot program  
and create PNG files from dot files  
and open them on Apple computers

Is it overkill? Maybe.  
But then again, I've run dot and open enough to not want to do it anymore.

Usage
===

Copy to either:
- /usr/local/bin
- your own user's bin/ directory

`doot file.dot`
